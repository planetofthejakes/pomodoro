# _**Pomodoro** Timer_

A timer for the people! 

I'm pretty terrible with productivity sometimes and like to provide a bit more structure around my work schedule when I find it hard to get started. The [_pomodoro technique_][1] is a classic productivity and time management method to help you focus intently and then reward yourself with a break. It provides a trigger for your brain to go into focus mode and transfer out into diffuse mode. 

Trust the process: 

* 25 minutes on 
    - no interruptions, deep focus
* 5 minutes off 
    - reward yourself with snacks, donuts, memes, coffee, stretching, staring at a wall

## Ideology

Your brain has two modes, [_focused and diffused_][2]. Whenever you are learning something, you must allow your brain to transition between these modes in order to allow the synaptic connections to form. 

Think of the focus mode as building a brick wall, stacking new bricks and adding the glue in between. The diffuse mode, when you take a step back, allows the glue to dry and hold the brick wall together instead crumbling away. 

**Spaced repetition**, practicing what you're learning over multiple days instead of cramming, is what transfers knowledge from your working memory into long term memory, providing time for that glue to dry between the bricks. 

Let me know what you think! Or don't!
